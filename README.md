# CV
This GitHub respository hosts the source code for building my personal CV.

The source code is based on the wonderful `datadrivencv` package written by **Nick Strayer** which can be found [here](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv)
Using the base given to me by the package, I slightly tweaked the output to my liking using the included CSS file and altered a bit of the R-markdown file.

The output can be viewed either by downloading the HTML and opening with the browser of your choosing. Or opening the PDF document.
Between the two, the HTML file has a bit more interactibility, however they both convey the same data.
